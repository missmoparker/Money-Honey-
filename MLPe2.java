//I liked playing around with the print and println differences
//I am still trying to figure out how to use the String command in different ways without producing an error
//Can you only use String with the length command or as a variable?
//Can this be a real check?
//1011 is my lucky number - there are about 10^11 stars in the galaxy and 10^11 bactera on your body
//funny coincidence right?
